# Setting Up Local Language Models for Your App

Setting up local language models for your app can significantly enhance its capabilities, enabling it to understand and generate text in multiple languages without relying solely on external APIs. This guide provides instructions on how to switch between cloud-based LLMs and open source LLMs. Note that recent updates now include additional providers such as Novita.

## Steps:

### For Cloud Version LLM Change:
<Steps>
### Step 1
Visit the chat screen to see the default LLM selected.
### Step 2
Click on the LLM selector to get a drop-down of various available models.
### Step 3
Choose the cloud-based LLM of your choice (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
</Steps>

### For Open Source LLM Change:
<Steps>
### Step 1
Edit the `.env` file to update variables such as `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_NAME`. Refer to [‚öôÔ∏è App Configuration](/Deploying/DocsGPT-Settings) for details.
### Step 2
Visit [‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Providers](/Models/cloud-providers) for the updated list of online models, ensuring you have the correct API keys and provider settings.
### Step 3
For self-hosted models, please refer to [üñ•Ô∏è Local Inference](/Models/local-inference). Popular open source options now include LLaMa.cpp, and also Novita can be used as a cloud-integrated alternative.
</Steps>

Explore and experiment to find the best fit for your application.
