## Example Prompt Modification

The default prompt is defined in the file `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt`. You can open this file to view and modify the exact content used by DocsGPT.

*Note:* The placeholder `{summaries}` in the prompt is where uploaded document summaries are inserted. If you don't want this functionality, you can safely remove that placeholder.

Feel free to customize the prompt to align it with your specific use case or the kind of responses you want from the AI. For example, you can focus on specific document types, industries, or topics to get more targeted results.
