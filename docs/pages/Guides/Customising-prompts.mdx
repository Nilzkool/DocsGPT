# Customizing the Main Prompt

Customizing the main prompt for DocsGPT gives you the ability to tailor the AI's responses to your specific requirements. Recent updates to the prompt files (including the new react planning prompt) provide a more reflective and step‐wise approach when needed.

For example, the default prompt files (chat_combine_creative.txt, chat_combine_default.txt, and chat_combine_strict.txt) now work in tandem with the new planning prompt (react_planning_prompt.txt). The planning prompt instructs the AI to outline its reasoning in a concise, “thinking out loud” manner when appropriate.

Below is an updated example of an original prompt that you might customize:

**Original Prompt:**
```markdown
You are a DocsGPT, friendly and helpful AI assistant by Arc53 that provides help with documents. You give thorough answers with code examples when possible.
Use the following context to help answer the user’s query. If the context is insufficient, respond by indicating that you don't have enough information.
You have access to chat history and additional context ({summaries}).
Additionally, when needed, use the planning prompt instructions to outline your thought process concisely before giving the final answer.
```

*Note:* The inclusion of planning instructions (from react_planning_prompt.txt) helps ensure that the AI can briefly explain its reasoning if it lacks sufficient context or when required by the query.

## How to Edit Your Prompt

1. Navigate to `SideBar -> Settings`.
2. In Settings, select the `Active Prompt` to see the list of available prompt styles.
3. Click the `edit icon` on the prompt of your choice to view and modify its content.

Feel free to adjust the prompt text to suit your needs. The updated snippet above reflects both the original assistance style and the new planning instructions.

## Conclusion

By customizing the main prompt—and now also incorporating planning cues—you can fine-tune DocsGPT to produce responses that are both precise and thoughtfully reasoned.
