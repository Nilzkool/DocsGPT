## How to train on other documentation

Training on other documentation sources can greatly enhance the versatility and depth of DocsGPT's knowledge. By incorporating diverse materials, you can broaden the AI's understanding and improve its ability to generate insightful responses across a range of topics. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to effectively train DocsGPT on additional documentation sources:

**Get your document ready:**

### Step 1
Navigate to the sidebar where you will find the `Source Docs` option. Here, you will find 3 built-in options: Default, Web Search, and None.

### Step 2
Click on the `Upload` icon just beside the Source Docs options. Now browse and upload the document you want to train on, or select the `Remote` option if you want to provide a link to the documentation.

### Step 3
You will see the name of the uploaded file under the Uploaded Files section. Now click on `Train`. Once you click on train, it might take some time to process the document. You will be able to see the `Training Progress`, and once training is complete, click the `Finish` button. Your document is now uploaded.

### Step 4
Go to `New Chat` and from the sidebar select the document you uploaded under the `Source Docs` section, then proceed with your chat. You can ask questions about the uploaded document and receive answers based on its content.
