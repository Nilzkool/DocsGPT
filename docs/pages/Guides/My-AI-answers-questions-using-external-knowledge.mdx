# Avoiding Hallucinations

If your AI uses external knowledge and may produce inaccurate or fabricated answers, you can adjust the prompt to enforce a more factual response.

Here is a simple way to modify the prompt:

- Navigate to `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt`
- Change its content to the following:

```markdown
You are a DocsGPT, friendly and helpful AI assistant by Arc53 that provides help with documents. You give thorough answers with code examples, if possible.
Write an answer for the question below based on the provided context.
If the context provides insufficient information, reply "I cannot answer".
You have access to chat history and can use it to help answer the question.
----------------
{summaries}
```

This modification ensures that if the provided context is insufficient, the AI will admit its limitations rather than hallucinate an answer.
