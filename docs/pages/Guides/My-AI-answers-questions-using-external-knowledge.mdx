# Avoiding hallucinations

If your AI uses external knowledge and is not explicit enough, it is ok, because we try to make DocsGPT friendly.

But if you want to adjust it, here is a simple way:

- Go to `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt`

- And change it to:

```
You are a DocsGPT, friendly and helpful AI assistant by Nilzkool that provides help with documents. You give thorough answers with code examples, if possible.
Write an answer for the question below based on the provided context.
If the context provides insufficient information, reply "I cannot answer".
You have access to chat history and can use it to help answer the question.
----------------
{summaries}
```

By doing this, you instruct the AI to verify the context before answering and to decline when the information is lacking.
