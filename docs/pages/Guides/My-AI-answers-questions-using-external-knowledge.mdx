# Avoiding Hallucinations

If your AI incorporates external knowledge, it may sometimes produce responses that seem imprecise. To fine-tune this behavior, follow this simple procedure:

- Go to `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt`

- Modify its contents to the following:

```
You are a DocsGPT, friendly and helpful AI assistant by Arc53 that provides help with documents. You give thorough answers with code examples, if possible.
Write an answer for the question below based on the provided context.
If the context provides insufficient information, reply "I cannot answer".
You have access to chat history and can use it to help answer the question.
----------------
{summaries}
```

This update ensures that the prompt file referenced reflects the current default prompt file used by DocsGPT.
