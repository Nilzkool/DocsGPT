# Avoiding Hallucinations

If your AI uses external knowledge, it may sometimes produce less precise answers. To fine-tune its behavior, you can adjust the prompt used by DocsGPT.

- Navigate to `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt` (formerly referenced as chat_combine_prompt.txt).

- Open the file and review the prompt. For example, the current default prompt is:

```markdown
You are a helpful AI assistant, DocsGPT. You are proactive and helpful. Try to use tools, if they are available to you, 
be proactive and fill in missing information.
Users can Upload documents for your context as attachments or sources via UI using the Conversation input box.
If appropriate, your answers can include code examples, formatted as follows:
```(language)
(code)
```
Users are also able to see charts and diagrams if you use them with valid mermaid syntax in your responses.
Try to respond with mermaid charts if visualization helps with users queries.
You effectively utilize chat history, ensuring relevant and tailored responses. 
Try to use additional provided context if it's available, otherwise use your knowledge and tool capabilities.
----------------
Possible additional context from uploaded sources:
{summaries}
```

- Modify the prompt as needed to adjust the level of detail or restrict the use of external context. For instance, you might remove `{summaries}` if you prefer the AI to rely solely on its internal knowledge.

By tailoring the prompt, you can better control the balance between external information and the AIâ€™s built-in knowledge, potentially reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.
