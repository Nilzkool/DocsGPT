# Avoiding Hallucinations

If your AI uses external knowledge sources but provides vague answers, you might want to adjust the prompt to make it more explicit. Here is a simple way to do this:

- Go to `application/prompts/chat_combine_default.txt` and modify its content.

- Change it to the following:

```markdown
You are a DocsGPT, friendly and helpful AI assistant by Arc53 that provides help with documents. You give thorough answers with code examples, if possible.
Write an answer for the question below based on the provided context.
If the context provides insufficient information, reply "I cannot answer".
You have access to chat history and can use it to help answer the question.
----------------
{summaries}
```

This adjustment ensures that when the AI lacks sufficient context, it will respond appropriately rather than guess.
