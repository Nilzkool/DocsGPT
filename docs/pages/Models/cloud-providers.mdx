# Connecting DocsGPT to Cloud LLM Providers

DocsGPT is designed to seamlessly integrate with a variety of Cloud Large Language Model (LLM) providers, giving you access to state-of-the-art AI models for document question answering.

## Configuration via `.env` file

The primary method for configuring your LLM provider in DocsGPT is through the `.env` file. For a comprehensive understanding of all available settings, please refer to the detailed [DocsGPT Settings Guide](/Deploying/DocsGPT-Settings).

To connect to a cloud LLM provider, you will typically need to configure the following basic settings in your `.env` file:

*   **`LLM_PROVIDER`**:  This setting is essential and identifies the specific cloud provider you wish to use (e.g., `openai`, `google`, `anthropic`).
*   **`LLM_NAME`**:  Specifies the exact model you want to utilize from your chosen provider (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`).  Refer to your provider's documentation for a list of available models.
*   **`API_KEY`**:  Almost all cloud LLM providers require an API key for authentication. Obtain your API key from your chosen provider's platform and securely store it in your `.env` file.

## Explicitly Supported Cloud Providers

DocsGPT offers direct, streamlined support for the following cloud LLM providers, making configuration straightforward.  The table below outlines the `LLM_PROVIDER` and example `LLM_NAME` values to use for each provider in your `.env` file.
