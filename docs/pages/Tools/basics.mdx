# Understanding DocsGPT Tools

DocsGPT Tools are powerful extensions that significantly enhance the capabilities of your DocsGPT application. 
They allow DocsGPT to move beyond its core function of retrieving information from your documents and enable it to perform actions, 
interact with external data sources, and integrate with other services. You can find and configure available tools within 
the "Tools" section of the DocsGPT application settings in the user interface.

## What are Tools?

-   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of Tools is to bridge the gap between understanding a user's request (natural language processing by the LLM) and executing a tangible action. This could involve fetching live data from the web, sending notifications, running code snippets, querying databases, or interacting with third-party APIs.

-   **LLM as an Orchestrator:** The Large Language Model (LLM) at the heart of DocsGPT is designed to act as an intelligent orchestrator. Based on your query and the declared capabilities of the available tools (defined in their metadata), the LLM decides if a tool is needed, which tool to use, and what parameters to pass to it.

-   **Action-Oriented Interactions:** Tools enable more dynamic and action-oriented interactions. For example:
    * *"What's the latest news on renewable energy?"* - This might trigger a web search tool to fetch current articles.
    * *"Fetch the order status for customer ID 12345 from our database."* - This could use a database tool.
    * *"Summarize the content of this webpage and send the summary to the #general channel on Telegram."* - This might involve a web scraping tool followed by a Telegram notification tool.

## Overview of Built-in Tools

DocsGPT includes a suite of pre-built tools designed to expand its capabilities out-of-the-box. Below is an overview of the currently available tools.
