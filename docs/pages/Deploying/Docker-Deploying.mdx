# Docker Deployment of DocsGPT

Docker is the recommended method for deploying DocsGPT, providing a consistent and isolated environment for the application to run. This guide will walk you through deploying DocsGPT using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

* **Docker Engine:** You need to have Docker Engine installed on your system.
    * **macOS:** [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    * **Linux:** [Docker Engine Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (follow instructions for your specific distribution)
    * **Windows:** [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (requires WSL 2 backend, see notes below)
* **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is usually included with Docker Desktop. If you are using Docker Engine separately, ensure you have Docker Compose V2 installed.

**Important Note for Windows Users:** Docker Desktop on Windows generally requires the WSL 2 backend to function correctly, especially when using features like host networking which are utilized in DocsGPT's Docker Compose setup. Ensure WSL 2 is enabled and configured in Docker Desktop settings.

## Quickest Setup: Using DocsGPT Public API

The fastest way to try out DocsGPT is by using the public API endpoint. This requires minimal configuration and no local LLM setup.

1.  **Clone the DocsGPT Repository (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git
    cd DocsGPT
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    In the root directory of the DocsGPT repository, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **Add Public API Configuration to `.env`:**

    Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

    ```
    API_KEY=<Your LLM API key>
    LLM_NAME=docsgpt
    VITE_API_STREAMING=true
    ```

    This minimal configuration tells DocsGPT to use the public API. For more advanced settings and other LLM options, refer to the [DocsGPT Settings Guide](/Deploying/DocsGPT-Settings).

4.  **Launch DocsGPT with Docker Compose:**

    Navigate to the root directory of the DocsGPT repository in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```

    The `-d` flag runs Docker Compose in detached mode (in the background).

5.  **Access DocsGPT in your browser:**

    Once the containers are running, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

6.  **Stopping DocsGPT:**

    To stop the application, navigate to the same directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml down
    ```
