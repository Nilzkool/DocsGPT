# Hosting DocsGPT on Your Own Infrastructure

Follow these instructions to deploy DocsGPT on your own server or cloud instance.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nilzkool/DocsGPT.git
```

### 2. Prepare the Environment

Inside the DocsGPT folder, create a `.env` file by copying the contents of `.env_sample`:

```bash
cp .env_sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file as needed, making sure to set the correct IP for the backend. For example, in the `deployment/docker-compose.yaml` file, change the line for `VITE_API_HOST` from:

```
VITE_API_HOST=http://localhost:7091
```

to:

```
VITE_API_HOST=http://<your instance public IP>:7091
```

### 3. Run the Application

Use the following command to start DocsGPT using Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

The first launch may take several minutes as Docker downloads and builds the necessary images. Once running, your instance will be available at the generated domain or your public IP.

### 4. Pushing to Your Own Repository

If you wish to host your customized version of DocsGPT, follow these steps to push the project to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first-commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Nilzkool/DocsGPT.git
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Your files are now pushed to your GitHub account.

Enjoy your self-hosted DocsGPT instance!
