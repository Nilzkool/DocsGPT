# Self-hosting DocsGPT on Railway

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to host DocsGPT on Railway App.

At first Clone and set up the project locally to run , test and Modify.

### 1. Clone and GitHub SetUp

a. Open Terminal (Windows Shell or Git bash(recommended)).

b. Type `git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git`

#### Download the package information

Once it has finished cloning the repository, it is time to download the package information from all sources. To do so, simply enter the following command:

`sudo apt update`

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

DocsGPT backend and worker use Python, Frontend is written on React and the whole application is containerized using Docker. To install Docker and Docker Compose, enter the following commands:

`sudo apt install docker.io`

And now install docker-compose:

`sudo apt install docker-compose`

#### Access the DocsGPT Folder

Enter the following command to access the folder in which the DocsGPT docker-compose file is present.

`cd DocsGPT/`

#### Prepare the Environment

Inside the DocsGPT folder create a `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env_sample` into it.

`nano .env`

Make sure your `.env` file looks like this:

```
API_KEY=<Your LLM API key>
LLM_NAME=docsgpt
VITE_API_STREAMING=true
```

To save the file, press CTRL+X, then Y, and then ENTER.

Next, set the correct IP for the Backend by opening the docker-compose.yaml file:

`nano deployment/docker-compose.yaml`

And Change line 7 to: `VITE_API_HOST=http://localhost:7091`
to this `VITE_API_HOST=http://<your instance public IP>:7091`

This will allow the frontend to connect to the backend.

#### Running the Application

You're almost there! Now that all the necessary bits and pieces have been installed, it is time to run the application. To do so, use the following command:

`sudo docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d`

Launching it for the first time will take a few minutes to download all the necessary dependencies and build.

Once this is done you can go ahead and close the terminal window.

### 2. Pushing it to your own Repository
