# Self-hosting DocsGPT on Railway

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to host DocsGPT on Railway App.

At first Clone and set up the project locally to run, test and modify.

```

sudo apt install docker-compose
```

```bash
cd DocsGPT/
```

#### Prepare the Environment

Inside the DocsGPT folder create a `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env-template` into it:

```bash
nano .env
```

Make sure your `.env` file includes at least the following settings:

```
API_KEY=(Your LLM API key, e.g., OpenAI API key)

```bash
sudo docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
