# Self-hosting DocsGPT on Railway

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to host DocsGPT on Railway.

## 1. Clone and Set Up Locally

At first, clone and set up the project locally to run, test and modify:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nilzkool/DocsGPT.git
cd DocsGPT/
```

#### Prepare the Environment

Inside the DocsGPT folder create a `.env` file and copy the contents of the `.env-template` file into it:

```bash
nano .env
```

Make sure your `.env` file looks like this:

```text
API_KEY=<Your LLM API key>
VITE_API_STREAMING=true
```

This aligns with the current code settings (see `.env-template`).

#### Running Locally

Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

This will start the backend and frontend in detached mode.

## 2. Push to Your Repository

Follow standard Git commands to push your changes to your own GitHub repository.

## 3. Deploy on Railway

1.  Create or log in to your Railway account at https://railway.app/
2.  Click "Start New Project" and choose "Deploy from GitHub Repo".
3.  Select your DocsGPT repository and authorize Railway to access it.
4.  In the "Variables" tab, upload or enter the same environment variables from your `.env` file.
5.  In the "Settings" tab, generate your project domain name under "Networking".
6.  Review the build and start commands; the defaults usually suffice.

Your DocsGPT instance will now be available at the generated Railway domain.
