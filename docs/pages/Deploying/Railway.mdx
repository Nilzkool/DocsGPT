# Self-hosting DocsGPT on Railway

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to host DocsGPT on Railway App.

## 1. Clone and GitHub SetUp

a. Open Terminal (Windows Shell or Git bash(recommended)).

b. Type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nilzkool/DocsGPT.git
cd DocsGPT/
```

### Download the package information

Once it has finished cloning the repository, it is time to download the package information from all sources. To do so, simply enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

DocsGPT backend and worker use Python, Frontend is written on React and the whole application is containerized using Docker. To install Docker and Docker Compose, enter the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

### Access the DocsGPT Folder

Enter the following command to access the folder in which the DocsGPT docker-compose file is present.

```bash
cd DocsGPT/
```

### Prepare the Environment

Inside the DocsGPT folder, create a `.env` file by copying from the provided `.env-template` in the repository root:

```bash
cp .env-template .env
```

Open the `.env` file for editing:

```bash
nano .env
```

Ensure your `.env` file includes at minimum the following settings:

```
API_KEY=<Your LLM API key>
LLM_NAME=docsgpt
VITE_API_STREAMING=true
```

Save and exit (CTRL+X, then Y, then ENTER).

#### Running the Application

You're almost there! Now that all the necessary bits and pieces have been installed, it is time to run the application. To do so, use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Launching it for the first time will take a few minutes to download all the necessary dependencies and build.

Once this is done you can go ahead and close the terminal window.

## 2. Pushing it to your own Repository

a. Create a Repository on your GitHub.

b. Open Terminal in the same directory of the Cloned project.

c. Type `git init`

d. `git add .`

e. `git commit -m "first-commit"`

f. `git remote add origin <your repository link>`

g. `git push --set-upstream origin master`

Your local files will now be pushed to your GitHub Account.

## 3. Create a Railway Account:

If you haven't already, create or log in to your railway account by visiting [Railway](https://railway.app/)

Signup via **GitHub** [Recommended].

## 4. Start New Project:

a. Open Railway app and click on "Start New Project."

b. Choose any from the list of options available (Recommended "**Deploy from GitHub Repo**").

c. Choose the required Repository from your GitHub.

d. Configure and allow access to modify your GitHub content from the pop-up window.

e. Agree to all the terms and conditions.

PS: It may take a few minutes for the account setup to complete.

### 5. Connecting to Your Railway App with GitHub

a. Choose the DocsGPT repo from the list of your GitHub repositories that you want to deploy now.

b. Click on "Deploy now."

c. Select the "Variables" tab.

d. Upload the `.env` file here that you used for local setup.

e. Go to the "Settings" tab now.

f. Go to "Networking" and click on "Generate Domain Name," to get the URL of your hosted project.

g. You can update the Root directory, build command, installation command as per need.

_However recommended not to disturb these options and leave them as default if not that needed._

Your own DocsGPT is now available at the generated domain URL. :)
